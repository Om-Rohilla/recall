## KEY DECISIONS MADE

| # | Decision | Reasoning | Date |
|---|----------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Go over Rust | Faster compilation, better CLI ecosystem (Cobra + Bubbletea), simpler concurrency, SQLite is the bottleneck not CPU | 2026-03-25 |
| 2 | modernc.org/sqlite over mattn/go-sqlite3 | Pure Go, no CGo, cross-compiles cleanly to all platforms | 2026-03-25 |
| 3 | FTS5 for search over custom indexing | Built into SQLite, handles tokenization + ranking, sub-ms queries | 2026-03-25 |
| 4 | Shell hook fires AFTER execution, not before | Never blocks user workflow, captures exit code + duration | 2026-03-25 |
| 5 | TOML over YAML for config | Simpler, no whitespace footguns, standard in Go ecosystem | 2026-03-25 |
| 6 | AES-256-GCM for vault encryption | Go stdlib, no external deps, industry standard | 2026-03-25 |
| 7 | Scoring weights: text 30%, intent 25%, freq 20%, context 15%, recency 10% | Balanced between relevance and personalization | 2026-03-25 |
| 8 | Phase 1 uses `recall capture` subcommand instead of Unix socket | Simpler, fast enough (<1ms), socket can be added in Phase 2 if needed | 2026-03-28 |
| 9 | Phase 1 FTS5 search uses OR-joined terms | Simple but effective for keyword matching; Phase 2 adds intent expansion | 2026-03-28 |
| 10 | Column named `binary_name` not `binary` in schema | `binary` is a reserved word in some SQL contexts | 2026-03-28 |
| 11 | Synonym dict as Go map, not external file | Faster, no file I/O, compiles into binary, easy to extend | 2026-03-29 |
| 12 | FTS5 query sanitization in store layer | Prevents double-processing when intelligence engine builds queries | 2026-03-29 |
| 13 | Log-normalized frequency scoring | Prevents power-law dominance by very high-frequency commands | 2026-03-29 |
| 14 | Context scoring uses best-match across all contexts for a command | More accurate than averaging — a command used once in matching context should score high | 2026-03-29 |
| 15 | Three-level danger system: Safe/Caution/Destructive | Maps to green/yellow/red in UI. Covers all common dangerous patterns | 2026-03-29 |
| 16 | Flag database as Go map, not external file | Same rationale as synonyms — compiles into binary, zero I/O, fast lookups | 2026-03-29 |
| 17 | `isCombinedFlags` detects multi-char single-dash flags, `explainCombinedFlags` resolves via DB lookup first | Correctly handles both `-xzvf` (combined) and `-name` (single flag for find) | 2026-03-29 |
| 18 | Generic `flagTakesValue` only applies to unknown flags; known DB flags never greedily consume next token | Prevents `-s` (silent in curl) from swallowing the URL argument | 2026-03-29 |
| 19 | Vault browser uses alt-screen mode (`tea.WithAltScreen`) for clean TUI experience | Doesn't pollute terminal scrollback | 2026-03-29 |
| 20 | Alias suggestions use longest-prefix matching against curated alias map | Predictable, high-quality alias names; avoids random map iteration issues | 2026-03-29 |
| 21 | Hotkeys: Ctrl+Space (search), Ctrl+K (vault), Ctrl+E (explain) in zsh and bash | Consistent with common editor/tool conventions | 2026-03-29 |
| 22 | Export format: magic "RECL" + version byte + 32-byte salt + nonce+ciphertext | Self-describing format, easy to detect vs plain JSON, forward-compatible with version byte | 2026-03-29 |
| 23 | Argon2id params: time=3, memory=64MB, threads=4 | Balanced security vs UX — fast enough for interactive use, strong enough against brute force | 2026-03-29 |
| 24 | Phase 5 encryption is export/import only, not vault DB at rest | Auto-encrypting SQLite DB is complex (page-level encryption), deferred to Phase 6+ | 2026-03-29 |
| 25 | Secure password input uses golang.org/x/term with bufio fallback | Handles both interactive terminals and piped input (CI, scripts) | 2026-03-29 |
| 26 | Fish hook uses fish_postexec event + CMD_DURATION builtin | Fish provides duration natively in ms, no manual timing needed unlike zsh/bash | 2026-03-29 |

## HARD RULES — NEVER VIOLATE THESE

### Privacy & Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **ZERO network calls.** Recall never contacts any server. No telemetry. No analytics. No update checks (except `recall update-kb` which is explicit and optional).
2. **Secret filtering.** Commands matching these patterns are NEVER stored: `password`, `token`, `secret`, `API_KEY`, `aws_secret`, `credentials`, `private_key`. Also filter: `export PASSWORD=...`, `curl -u user:pass ...`
3. **Vault encryption.** AES-256-GCM at rest. Key derived from Argon2id.
4. **No stdout leaking.** Never print stored commands to logs, debug output, or crash reports unless the user explicitly runs a recall command.
5. **Respect NO_COLOR.** If `NO_COLOR` env var is set, disable all colors.

### Code Quality (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
6. **No panics.** Always return errors. Let the caller handle display.
7. **Wrap all errors.** `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` — every error must have context.
8. **No business logic in cmd/.** Commands are thin wrappers. Logic lives in `internal/`.
9. **Test everything critical.** Scoring algorithm, FTS5 queries, secret filtering, command parsing — all must have tests.
10. **<1ms capture overhead.** The shell hook must be invisible to the user.
11. **<10ms search latency.** Queries must feel instant. Use prepared statements. Use FTS5.

### Architecture (DON'T CHANGE WITHOUT DISCUSSION)
12. **4 layers.** Capture → Intelligence → Surface → Vault. Don't merge them.
13. **Single SQLite file.** Everything in one database at `~/.local/share/recall/vault.db`.
14. **Single binary.** No sidecar processes, no daemons, no background services.
15. **Shell hooks are shell scripts.** The hook is a tiny shell script that calls `recall capture`. Not a Go binary running in the background.

## LESSONS LEARNED

| # | Lesson | Context |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | modernc.org/sqlite v1.48 requires Go 1.25+, go mod auto-upgraded | Phase 1: go.mod switched from go 1.24.1 to 1.25.0 |
| 2 | FTS5 triggers must be created after the virtual table | Phase 1: schema.go creation order matters |
| 3 | Use `ON CONFLICT(raw) DO UPDATE` for batch imports — much cleaner than check-then-insert | Phase 1: store.go BatchInsertCommands |
| 4 | Parser classifies `npm install express` as subcommand="install express" since npm is a multi-cmd tool — acceptable for Phase 1, refine in Phase 2 | Phase 1: parser tests |
| 5 | FTS5 OR queries fail if "OR" tokens are double-wrapped — store layer must sanitize, not re-wrap | Phase 2: FTS5 query handling between intelligence engine and vault |
| 6 | Knowledge base FTS5 content-sync table needs explicit rebuild after batch insert via transaction | Phase 2: LoadKnowledgeBase calls RebuildKnowledgeFTSIndex after batch |
| 7 | Stop word removal before synonym expansion prevents noise in FTS5 queries | Phase 2: intent.go tokenization pipeline |
| 8 | Pipeline operator should be stored as trailing (after segment), not leading — rendering must emit after each segment, not before | Phase 3: parser.go splitPipeline |
| 9 | Generic `flagTakesValue` heuristic must NOT override tool-specific flag database — known flags shouldn't greedily consume next token | Phase 3: parser.go flag handling |
| 10 | `isCombinedFlags` matches multi-letter single-dash flags like `-name`, `-type` — must check flag database first in `explainCombinedFlags` to handle them correctly | Phase 3: parser.go combined flag detection |
| 11 | Alias suggestion must use longest-prefix matching against known alias map — Go map iteration is random, shorter prefixes match first otherwise | Phase 4: suggest.go longest prefix fix |
| 12 | bubbletea + bubbles require `go get` of subpackages (e.g., bubbles/textinput) to appear in go.sum | Phase 4: dependency management |
| 13 | GetAllCommands with limit=0 must mean "no limit" — conditional SQL query needed | Phase 5: ExportVaultData was getting 0 commands because LIMIT 0 returns nothing |
| 14 | Export file format needs magic header for detection — `RECL` + version byte allows forward compatibility | Phase 5: crypto.go PackExport/UnpackExport |
| 15 | ImportVaultData needs context ID remapping — imported commands reference context IDs from the source vault | Phase 5: store.go ImportVaultData builds oldID→newID map |
| 16 | fmt.Errorf with %s format verb requires matching argument — caught by `go vet` in config_cmd.go | Phase 5: config_cmd.go validateAndSet error message |
